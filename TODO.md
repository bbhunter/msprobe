- Create logic for single library function
- Make sure package creation on the right path
- better exception handling in modules
- Think I can still parse info from NTLM but but actually spray: see here https://github.com/ReverendThing/Carnivore/blob/master/sLYNCy-WPF/DomainEnumeration/NTLMDiscovery.cs - yes I definately can - need to mod existing library for this 
- Improve individual displays and display of all tables during full discovery
- add fireworks when everything is found for domain
- error handling added specifically for exch redirect to O365 situation
- add output file and logging functionality
- allow -v or -vv for info or debug (info will just be messages we add manually to modules)
